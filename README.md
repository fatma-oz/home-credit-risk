# home-credit-risk-project


*Home credit data includes many tables. (application train,Bureau and Bureau Balance,Installment Payments,Pos Cash Balance,Credit Card Balance,previous_application)

*It is estimated whether the customers can pay the loan on time or not by using the data of their past payment behaviors.

*The problem of MERGING tables in this data has been resolved.

*Feature engineering was applied for each table. Aggregation functions were used for this.

*In the project, PRODUCTION LEVEL CODING was done using functions.

*LIGHTGBM was used as machine learning model.

*The model was finally run with a single function called main.

*A table of the most important variables for LIGHTGBM has been created.

*Developed with Jupyter Notebook, Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

*I worked on this project with my teammates.I focused on Bureau and Bureau Balance tables.
